# Image-Editor

A simple voice-command enabled image editor with implementations of OpenCV functions, and pre-trained Neural Style Transfer models.

Requirements:

1.	Opencv:
2.	Numpy:
3.	Scipy:
4.	Speechrecognition:
5.	Pyaudio:
This one is a bit tricky. Open cmd, or anaconda prompt, after typing “pip install”, type file path of the .whl file which is given, or dragging the file with mouse cursor to the prompt window will do the same work.

Intstruction:
•	In case of using microphone, please try to keep surrounding as quiet as possible, covering the mic with hand after giving command helps the process.
•	After each command, please click on the image for once and press any key (e.g. enter) to continue with the program.
•	Please keep the folder labeled as “model” in the same folder with the source code.
•	If you are using cmd or anaconda prompt to run the code, you can drag your image into the prompt window after the “Input image” text. And in other cases, you will have to write the image path with file extension.
