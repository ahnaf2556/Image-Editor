Voice-Command Enabled Image Editor
</h4>

## Project Overview

A voice-command enabled image editor with implementations of OpenCV functions and pre-trained Neural Style Transfer models.

## Requirements:

1.	Opencv
2.	Numpy
3.	Scipy
4.	Speechrecognition
5.	Pyaudio - Open cmd, or anaconda prompt, after typing “pip install”, type the file path of the .whl file given, or dragging the file with the mouse cursor to the prompt window will do the same work.

## Features and Instructions:

-	In case of using a microphone, please try to keep surroundings as quiet as possible, covering the mic with your hand after giving a command helps the process.
-	After each command, please click on the image once and press any key (e.g. enter) to continue with the program.
-	Please keep the folder labeled as “model” in the same folder with the source code.
-	If you use cmd or anaconda prompt to run the code, you can drag your image into the prompt window after the “Input image” text. In other cases, you must write the image path with the file extension.
